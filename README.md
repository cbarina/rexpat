# Welcome to something random (for now)

A test place to jot down notes for living abroad in a more [intercultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interculturalism){:target="_blank"} manner. 

Will soon include jottings for Liberia, Mongolia, and other places, hopefully with datestamps so you know if the info is way too outdated or not. Also, since this site is using github, pull requests to edit should be possible. We'll see!

Markdown is pretty simple, but if you want more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/){:target="_blank"}.
