A test place to jot down notes for living abroad in a more [intercultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interculturalism){:target="_blank"} manner. 

Will soon include notes for [Monrovia, Liberia](monrovia-liberia), Hanoi, Mongolia, and other places, hopefully with datestamps so you know if the info is way too outdated or not. Also, since this site is using github, pull requests to edit should be possible. We'll see!

Here's the latest [location template](location-template.md) for starting off...

## Something's wrong/old/outdated!
You can edit it directly and submit it to be updated! Here's a [quick guide](https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2014/10/06/editing-on-github-a-non-technical-explainer/){:target="_blank"} as to how to do that - you'll neeed to know the location filename to do so (naming convention: countryname-cityname.md).

Alternatively, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/cbarina/rexpat/issues), but I would love to have people learning a bit of github as well as fixing things directly.

## The template could be better...
If you are a systems-person, and want to change it allll, it's the same process as above for updating location information. Again, here's a guide on [how to edit in github](https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2014/10/06/editing-on-github-a-non-technical-explainer/){:target="_blank"}.

## I want to add a place!
The basic process would be to fork the project, make a new file based on the template, then submit a pull request. It's a tiny bit more complicated than direct editing - here's a [tutorial on contributing via forks](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-in-the-browser/03-forking/). Since this isn't software, just text, it's about 1000% simpler; I'll see about a tutorial someday if this is useful...

## Rexpat?
There isn't quite a word coined for what I'm referring to, but this [rexpat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rex-pat) idea seemed to be the closest, alongside the [intercultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interculturalism){:target="_blank"} thing. If you're someone who moves a bit, you probably know that sense of moving and making a new home as soon as you can, but also trying to suss out local norms. There's a differential no matter what - you very likely make a good amont more than your local colleagues - but how do you navigate that?

This site is focused on how to not necessarily live like a local, but also how to not live in a bubble. How can we be a good neighbor and community member, and how do we mesh our home cultures with the culture we find ourselves in while abroad? Basically, how do we live abroad, better?

This is a bit different from the digital nomad-type work approach described by some, though some of the information may apply. In general it assumes you have local colleagues and local neighbors.
